            <h2>Basic Level (Concept Foundations)</h2>
            
            <div class="question">
                <h3>1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around <span class="highlight">objects</span> containing data (attributes) and methods (functions). It models real-world entities and promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability through concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>2. What are the four main pillars of OOP? Explain each with examples.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data and methods together while hiding internal details (private variables with public getters/setters).<br><br>
                    <strong>Inheritance:</strong> Creating new classes from existing ones (<code>Car extends Vehicle</code>).<br><br>
                    <strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Same interface with different implementations (<code>Animal.makeSound()</code> behaves differently for Dog and Cat).<br><br>
                    <strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features (abstract classes/interfaces).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>3. What is a class? What is an object?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    A <span class="highlight">class</span> is a blueprint or template that defines attributes and methods for creating objects. An <span class="highlight">object</span> is an instance of a class that occupies memory and has actual values for the attributes defined in the class.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>4. What is the difference between a class and a structure (C++)?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    In C++, the main difference is default access: <code>struct</code> members are public by default, while <code>class</code> members are private by default. Both support constructors, destructors, inheritance, and member functions, but structs are typically used for simple data grouping.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>5. What is encapsulation? Why is it important?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Encapsulation bundles data and methods within a class while controlling access through access specifiers. It's important for <span class="highlight">data security</span> (prevents unauthorized access), <span class="highlight">data integrity</span> (validates modifications), and <span class="highlight">maintainability</span> (internal changes don't affect external code).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>6. What is abstraction? How is it achieved in Java and C++?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Abstraction hides implementation complexity and shows only essential features. In <strong>Java:</strong> achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. In <strong>C++:</strong> achieved through pure virtual functions and abstract classes with virtual methods.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>7. What are access specifiers (public, private, protected)?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Public:</strong> accessible everywhere.<br>
                    <strong>Private:</strong> accessible only within the same class.<br>
                    <strong>Protected:</strong> accessible within the same class and its subclasses.<br><br>
                    They control visibility and access to class members for encapsulation.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>8. What is the difference between compile-time and runtime polymorphism?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Compile-time polymorphism</strong> (static binding) is resolved during compilation through method overloading and operator overloading - faster execution.<br><br>
                    <strong>Runtime polymorphism</strong> (dynamic binding) is resolved during execution through method overriding and virtual functions - more flexible but slower.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>9. What is inheritance? How is it implemented in Java and C++?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class. <strong>Java:</strong> uses <code>extends</code> keyword for single inheritance. <strong>C++:</strong> uses colon notation and supports multiple inheritance with public/private/protected access levels.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>10. What is a constructor and destructor?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Constructor:</strong> Special method called when object is created to initialize its state, has same name as class.<br><br>
                    <strong>Destructor:</strong> Special method called when object is destroyed to clean up resources, preceded by <code>~</code> in C++. Java uses garbage collection instead of explicit destructors.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section level-intermediate" id="intermediate-level">
            <h2>Intermediate Level (Language Features)</h2>
            
            <div class="question">
                <h3>1. What is method overloading and method overriding?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Method overloading:</strong> Multiple methods with same name but different parameters in the same class (compile-time polymorphism).<br><br>
                    <strong>Method overriding:</strong> Child class provides specific implementation of parent's method with same signature (runtime polymorphism).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>2. What is the difference between virtual functions (C++) and method overriding (Java)?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>C++</strong> requires explicit <code>virtual</code> keyword and methods are non-virtual by default, supports pure virtual functions.<br><br>
                    <strong>Java</strong> methods are virtual by default, uses <code>@Override</code> annotation for clarity, and doesn't need explicit virtual keyword.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>3. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Abstract class:</strong> Can have concrete and abstract methods, instance variables, constructors, single inheritance.<br><br>
                    <strong>Interface:</strong> Only abstract methods (before Java 8), constants only, no constructors, supports multiple inheritance.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>4. How is multiple inheritance handled in C++ vs Java?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>C++:</strong> Supports direct multiple class inheritance but can cause diamond problem, solved using virtual inheritance.<br><br>
                    <strong>Java:</strong> No multiple class inheritance, only multiple interface implementation to avoid complexity and ambiguity.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>5. What is a friend function in C++? Is there an equivalent in Java?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Friend function in C++ is a non-member function that can access private/protected members of a class using <code>friend</code> keyword. Java has no direct equivalent but uses package-private access and nested classes for similar functionality.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>6. What is this keyword and when do you use it?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <code>this</code> refers to the current object instance. Used to distinguish between instance variables and parameters, call other constructors, return current object for method chaining, and pass current object to other methods.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>7. What is super keyword in Java and how is it different from base keyword in C++?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Java's <code>super</code> refers to immediate parent class for accessing parent methods, variables, and constructors. C++ has no base keyword; instead uses direct class name or scope resolution operator (<code>::</code>) to access parent class members.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>8. What is operator overloading (C++)? Why doesn't Java allow it?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    C++ operator overloading allows redefining operators (<code>+, -, ==</code>) for user-defined types making code intuitive. Java doesn't allow it to maintain simplicity, consistency, readability, and prevent confusion about operator behavior.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>9. What is a static member (variable or method)?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Static members belong to the class rather than instances, shared among all objects, accessed using class name, loaded when class is loaded. Static methods cannot access instance variables directly.
                </div>
            </div>

                <h3>1. What is a virtual destructor in C++? Why is it important?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    Virtual destructor ensures proper cleanup when deleting objects through base class pointers by making destructor calls polymorphic. Without it, only base class destructor is called, leading to <span class="highlight">memory leaks</span> and incomplete cleanup of derived class resources.

                <div class="answer">
                    Pure virtual function has no implementation in base class (declared with <code>= 0</code>). It makes the class abstract (cannot be instantiated) and forces derived classes to provide implementation, ensuring consistent interface across inheritance hierarchy.

                <div class="answer">
                    Dependency injection provides dependencies to an object rather than the object creating them internally. It promotes <span class="highlight">loose coupling</span>, testability, and flexibility by removing hard-coded dependencies, aligning with OOP principles of modularity and abstraction.

                <div class="answer">
                    No, constructors cannot be virtual because objects don't exist during construction, so virtual table pointer isn't set yet. Virtual mechanism requires existing object, but constructor's job is to create the object and initialize virtual table pointer.
